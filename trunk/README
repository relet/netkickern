= about = 

This is just a quick readme file to get you started. As information in text files gets outdated too quickly, please refer to the netkickern wiki at http://relet.net/trac/netkickern if you encounter anything unexpected.

= requirements = 

Netkickern is written in Python. Based on the dependencies, it should run on Linux/Unix and Windows environments. I have only tested it on Ubuntu Linux, though.

* Python (>= 2.4 tested): http://python.org
* Panda3d (1.4.2 tested, 1.5.2 known to be broken): http://panda3d.org
* pyode (1.2.0 tested): http://pyode.sourceforge.net/

You should find python and pyode in most debianesque package trees, packages for Panda3d can be downloaded from their site.

= running = 

> python kickern.py

will start the game in server mode. The game will wait for another player to connect.

> python kickern.py server

will start the game in client mode. The game will try to connect to "server" (IP or resolvable hostname).

= playing = 

Move your mouse to move all players at once. Try to score by pushing the ball into the opposite (right) goal.

= configuration =

Configuration is not implemented yet. Some things may be configured by parameters at the beginning of the python file.
This includes team names, network ports and data directiories.

If you're an experienced or enthusiastic 3d or game designer, or just interested in contributing, please contact me.

I'm especially looking for
 - high quality, accurate textures and models of tables and players
 - official measurements and photos of tournament tables
 - improvements in physics/mouse handling which allow to catch the ball and generally make the gameplay more realistic

Enjoy.
